ToDo:
2) Look for weaknesses in the program: are all bases covered?
3) Refactor:
-use more Rust idioms
-which variables are really needed
-add documentation
4) Test: Is it possible to run exhaustive testing on the program?
-By replacing the random computer pick by a second "input" and running all possible input combinations for tic tac toe
